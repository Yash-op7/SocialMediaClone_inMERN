# SocialMediaClone_inMERN
A project part of a course on MERN stack to replicate an app similar to popular social media apps. Self Project

Built a comprehensive project as part of a MERN stack course, aimed at building a fully responsive social media application from scratch.

Implemented functionalities such as user registration with support for multiple sign-ups, handling media uploads, and the establishment of a robust user network, post creation, liking, disliking, viewing, and deletion, as well as the capability to add comments and tag friends and included support for optional advertisements.

Designed an interactive and clean interface, offering support for both light and dark modes.

Technologies used were the MERN stack, more specifically I used React for the frontend, along with React Router for navigation, Formik and Yup for  form validation, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Redux Persist to store data locally and React Dropzone for image uploads on the frontend.
On the backend, used Node.js as the runtime environment, Express.js as the backend framework, Mongoose for MongoDB management, JWT for authentication, and Multer for file uploads.
